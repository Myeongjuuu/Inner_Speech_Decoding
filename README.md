# ICASSP 2027 — Inner Speech EEG Analysis

EEG preprocessing, run-held-out CSP classification, and exploratory task/rest connectivity analysis for the [Inner Speech dataset, ds003626 v2.1.2](https://doi.org/10.18112/openneuro.ds003626.v2.1.2).

The original notebooks remain unchanged in their two historical folders. New shared code lives in `src/inner_speech`; new notebooks call that code instead of duplicating it. The group pipeline is implemented, but a validated group-level scientific finding is **not** claimed. See [validation status](docs/validation.md) and [analysis plan and limitations](docs/analysis_plan.md).

## Install and configure

Python 3.11 is the tested interpreter. From the repository root:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
# Activate the virtual environment for your shell.
python -m pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

Copy `configs/default.yaml` to `configs/local.yaml`. Set `dataset_root` to the separately downloaded dataset and `output_root` to a local results directory. Relative paths resolve against the YAML file. Set `preprocessing.scratch_dir` if the OS temporary drive has less than approximately 3 GiB free. Filtering/ICA also require substantial RAM and time. Review bad channels/ICA rather than assuming the starting settings suit every recording.

## Execute in stages

```bash
python -m inner_speech.cli audit --config configs/local.yaml
# Review condition counts, event sequences and eligible pairs in the audit CSVs.
python -m inner_speech.cli preprocess --config configs/local.yaml
python -m inner_speech.cli connectivity --config configs/local.yaml
python -m inner_speech.cli classify --config configs/local.yaml
# Only after all planned participants and sessions pass QC:
python -m inner_speech.cli statistics --config configs/local.yaml
python -m pytest -q
```

For a first run, explicitly select `subjects: [sub-01]` and `sessions: [ses-01]` in the local config. This is an execution check, **not** a group analysis. Group inference requires at least five unique participants by default and fails if any planned session is missing. Use a different output directory for each changed configuration; generated files within a run directory are overwritten on rerun.

Open the five notebooks after installation. They use `configs/default.yaml` unless environment variable `INNER_SPEECH_CONFIG` points to a local YAML. New notebooks contain no claimed results or saved executions.

## Changes from the historical notebooks

- Select inner-speech blocks with marker 22; direction labels alone do not identify condition.
- Report/discard malformed trials and measure action/rest bounds without inventing triggers.
- Recalculate event samples after resampling; match task/rest durations and paired QC.
- Exclude stimulus/external channels; estimate connectivity across trials for all unique EEG pairs.
- Add debiased squared wPLI and participant-level contrasts with one max-T family across configured methods, bands and edges.
- Fit CSP inside each training fold, holding out entire runs; report balanced accuracy and macro-F1.
- Describe the time-frequency implementation correctly as multitaper.

The task/rest comparison remains observational. Inter-trial rest, shared stimuli, residual artifacts and sensor mixing limit interpretation. Significant sensor connections are not causal/anatomical links or proof of inner-speech specificity. The plan follows inspection of exploratory results and is not preregistered confirmation. See the analysis plan for assumptions and limitations, including shared session-level ICA in classification.

## Original archive

The 17 original top-level `.ipynb`, `.py` and `.m` files retain their exact bytes, saved outputs, empty files and variants. Data, external weights and checkpoints are excluded. Old notebooks contain obsolete paths, possible evaluation leakage and incomplete experiments. External EEGNet inference is excluded from the new execution path. No code license has been selected; dataset licensing does not assign a license to this source code.
